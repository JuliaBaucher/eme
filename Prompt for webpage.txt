*GOAL

Create a high-end, single-page chatbot interface that serves as a concierge for Monégasque companies. It must answer questions about maturity diagnostics, the professional directory, funding, and the 2026 AI integration roadmap (FlashLearn IA).



*VISUAL IDENTITY

Visual identity specification already done as part of this project 



*FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CHATBOT WEBPAGE 

1. Robust Input Validation (Guardrails)

Empty State Prevention: The "Send" action (button click or Enter key) must be disabled if the input is empty or contains only whitespace.

Character Budgeting: * Hard limit the input (e.g., 4000 characters).

Provide a visual counter that changes color (e.g., turns red) as the user approaches the limit.

Sanitization: All user and system messages must be treated as plain text or passed through a sanitization library before rendering to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

2. State & Persistence Management

Session Continuity: Use localStorage to save the chat array. On page reload, the frontend should check for existing data and re-render the conversation history.

Manual Reset: A "Clear Chat" feature must exist to allow users to wipe their local history and reset the UI state.

Message Attribution: Each message object in the frontend state should include a unique ID, a timestamp, and a "role" (user, assistant, or system/error).

3. Interaction Design (UX)

Auto-Scroll: The chat container must automatically scroll to the bottom whenever a new message (user or assistant) is added.

Optimistic UI / Loading States: * Immediately display the user's message in the chat upon sending.

Display a "Typing" or "Thinking" indicator while the API request is pending.

Keyboard Ergonomics: * Enter to send.

Shift + Enter to create a new line (essential for long-form questions).

Automatically refocus the input field after a message is sent or the chat is cleared.

4. Resilient Error Handling

The frontend must gracefully handle failures independent of the backend's specific logic:

Network Timeouts: If the fetch request takes longer than a defined threshold (e.g., 30 seconds), show a "Request Timed Out" message.

Friendly Error Bubbles: Instead of a generic browser alert, render error messages as special "system" chat bubbles.

Input Retention: If a message fails to send, the user's original text should remain in the input box (or provide a "Retry" button) so they don't have to re-type it.

5. Accessibility (A11y)

Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA): * Use aria-live="polite" on the message container so screen readers announce new replies.

Ensure all buttons have descriptive aria-label attributes.

Visual Contrast: Maintain a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for text against backgrounds to support users with visual impairments.

Focus Management: Ensure a visible focus ring exists for keyboard-only users navigating the interface.

6. Responsive & Adaptive UI

Fluid Layout: The chat window should adapt to mobile, tablet, and desktop widths without losing functionality.

Flexible Textarea: The input box should grow vertically (up to a maximum height) as the user types multiple lines, rather than forcing a scrollbar inside a tiny box.

7. Optional "Quality of Life" Features

Markdown Support: Render the assistant's response using a Markdown parser to support bolding, bullet points, and code blocks for technical CV details.

Copy to Clipboard: Add a "Copy" button to assistant responses, making it easy for users to save specific information.

Dark/Light Mode: A toggle to switch themes based on user preference or system settings.



*TRUST

To establish trust on the EME Monaco chatbot page, you must combine official government branding and HTTPS security with transparent AI disclosure disclaimers, clear data privacy guardrails (like a "Clear Chat" button), and a visible "human fallback" link to official administrative channels.
